# type-scaf

Type-Scaf is a development tool designed to help you quickly generate form components and Storybook stories based on JavaScript classes. It aims to simplify building consistent UI components in your React projects, using a types-driven approach for automation.

## Getting Started

**Note:** You do not need to set up a new Vite project to use Type-Scaf. It integrates seamlessly into any existing React project.

### Features

- Automated Component Generation: Transform your JavaScript types into form components, saving time on boilerplate.

- Storybook Integration: Quickly visualize and interact with your components in Storybook.

### Prerequisites

- React project, JavaScript only for now; TypeScript templates may be added in the future (thats not to say the default template can't be modified to produce Typescript).

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Create a New React Project (Optional)

You can add Type-Scaf to any existing React project. If you need to start fresh, you can create a new project with Vite.

```Bash
npm create vite@latest
```

**Note:** Type-Scaf currently only supports JavaScript, so avoid using TypeScript during setup.

#### 2. Install Storybook (Optional)

Storybook is used to view and test the components generated by Type-Scaf.

```Bash
npx storybook init
```

##### Clear Pending Changes (Optional)

If you are just starting or want a clean working state, you can initialize a Git repository and commit your changes:

```Bash
git init

git add .

git commit -m "Ground zero"
```

#### 3. Initialize Type-Scaf

To initialize Type-Scaf in your project, run:

```Bash
npx github:leewinter/type-scaf init
```

This command will add the necessary dependencies and scripts to your project.

#### 4. Configuration

After initialization, you should see a `type-scaf/config` folder and a `package-types.ts` file created in the root of your project. The `package-types.ts` file contains example classes that you can modify to suit your needs.

You should also have a `type-scaf/templates` folder with ejs templates used for generating the components and stories. The init command won't replace these files unless deleted so feel free to modify as required.

#### 5. Generate Components

Run the following command to generate components using the example types:

```Bash
npm run scaf-transform
```

This will generate React components and Storybook stories in your `src` directory.

#### 6. View Your Components

```Bash
npm run storybook
```

You should now be able to see and interact with the generated components in Storybook.

### Notes

- Storybook Integration: Running Storybook is optional but highly recommended for visualizing and verifying the generated components.
